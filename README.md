# LTVision

LTVision is an open-source library designed to empower businesses to unlock the full potential of predictive Lifetime Value (pLTV) modeling. Our mission is to grow the pie for everyone in the pLTV ecosystem and lead the industry in thought leadership, expertise, and best practices.

**What is LTVision?**
--------------------

LTVision is a package containing two modules that help businesses evaluate and implement pLTV models tailored to their diverse needs.

### Module 1: Customer Insights and pLTV Opportunity Size Estimation

This module is now available and provides the following features:

* Generate customer behavioral insights to inform business decisions
* Estimate pLTV opportunity size to evaluate the potential ROI of implementing a pLTV model and strategy

With Module 1, business decision-makers can assess the value of investing in pLTV modeling before committing resources.

### Module 2: User-Level pLTV Model Development

Currently in development, this module will provide a code base for building user-level pLTV models. This will enable businesses to create customized models that drive long-term revenue growth and sustainable business success.

    ```
    for Windows:
    ```python
    activate venv
    ```

  * Setting up requirements:
    ```python
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  * Running jupyter notebook with created environment.

    To run this step, first make sure that `jupyter notebook`, `ipython` and `ipykernel` packages are installed.
    ```python
    ipython kernel install --user --name=venv
    jupyter notebook
