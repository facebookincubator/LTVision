# LTVision

LTVision is an open-source library designed to empower businesses to unlock the full potential of predicted customer lifetime value (pLTV) modeling. Our vision is to lead the industry by building a community of pLTV practitioners that drives innovation and creates value for everyone in the pLTV ecosystem through expertise, education, and thought leadership.

**What is LTVision?**
--------------------

LTVision contains two modules:

### Module 1: Customer Insights and pLTV Opportunity Size Estimation

This module is now available and focuses on generating customer insights and estimating pLTV opportunity size, to help business decision makers evaluate the potential ROI of this initiative before investing in a pLTV model and pLTV strategy.

### Module 2: User-Level pLTV Model

Currently in development, this module will provide a code base for building user-level pLTV models that businesses can use as an optimization signal on digital marketing platforms to drive long-term business growth.

    ```python
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    for Windows:
    ```python
    activate venv
    ```

    ```python
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  * Run jupyter notebook with created environment.

    To run this step, first make sure that `jupyter notebook`, `ipython` and `ipykernel` packages are installed.
    ```python
    ipython kernel install --user --name=venv
    jupyter notebook
